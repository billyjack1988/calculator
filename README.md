# Calculator 

assenment:
We want to make a new calculator app.
- we want a log in page that makes the user pick a user name and password.(define user and pass somewhere to compare inputs)
- Have atleast three sets of log in credentials that work.(think hashes or arrays)
- If valid user and password then allow user to move on to next step(pass along message that says successfull log in )
- if invalid then send them back to pick again with a message telling them which is invalid
- we also want the user to be able to input there first and last name and carry throughout.
- we want the user to be able to insert any two numbers and an operator( add, subtract, multiply or divide.) Please use radio buttons to make your choice(hint: w3schools)
- Now do the actual math by calling in your math functions that you have previously made.
- send all of this into a results view (both numbers and results)
- In your view i want to see something like 2 + 7 = 9 (i donâ€™t want to see 2 addition 7)
- finally give me  the option to pick new numbers.
